# Sorting_Algorithms

# Classification Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of well-known sorting algorithms in various programming languages.

## Algorithms contained

1. Bubble Sort: A sorting algorithm that iterates over and over by keeping track of sorted pairs of items and swapping them if necessary.

2. Selection Sort: A sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from the computed subarray and places it in the appropriate position.

3. Quick Sort: Sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer principle. Uses the odd number recursively.

4. Insertion Sort: A sorting algorithm that continuously builds a sorted subarray starting from the first element and expanding it one by one.

5. Merge Sort: Sorting algorithm based on the merge process. It uses recursion to split and merge subarrays.

## Instructions for use
Each folder contains the code for a particular sorting algorithm in these programming languages: Python, Java, C++ and C. You can open the corresponding folder to view the code and run it.

Usage examples:

### PYTHON
